Hi! Iâ€™m Kaliyah Fisher, or rather, @KaliyahFisher

Welcome to my GitHub! For starters, I am currently a senior at Auburn University, pursuing a degree in Computer Science with a Business Concentration.
My career aspiration is to become a game developer, but until then, I'm happy learning anything I can about coding!

I've worked with Java and C/C++, but I am currently teaching myself Javascript. Hopefully I'll have some sample code posted soon!
